# GPT2-Twitter-Facts

To learn and gain experience in the AI/ deeplearning field, I trained a GPT2 model on 800,000 facts. The facts are scraped from various twitter accounts. 
I trained the GPT2 355M model, in the future I would like to train a better model, but due to hardware limitations this was not possible at the time.

The GPT2 part of this project is cloned from https://github.com/nshepperd/gpt-2.

The generated tweets that are used by the bot can be found in /twitter-bot/AItweets.txt.

The bot is very simple and uses the twitter API to post tweets.
